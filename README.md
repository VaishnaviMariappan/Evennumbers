# Exp-4 Java program to print the even numbers between 1-20

## Aim:

To Write a Java program to print the even numbers from 1 to 20

## Algorithm:
1. Create a loop that iterates from 1 to 20.
 
2. Inside the loop, check if the current number is even.

3. If the number is even, print it.

4. Continue the loop until all numbers from 1 to 20 are checked.

## Program:
``` java
public class even
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        for(int i=0;i<=20;i++)
        {
            if(i%2==0)
            {
                System.out.print(i+" ");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Result:

Thus a java program to print the even numbers from 1 to 20.
